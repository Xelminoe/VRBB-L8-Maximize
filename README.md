# VRBB L8 Maximizer

Assist planning L8 resonator max-out using VRBB â€” e.g. 3 agents from the same side build an L8 portal in 15 minutes.

This tool helps coordinate resonator deployment under Virtual Rare Battle Beacons (VRBB), supporting multi-agent flip strategies, phase transitions, and deployment timing.

## Versions

- **Web App**: No installation required. Visit in any modern browser to simulate strategies interactively. https://xelminoe.github.io/VRBB-L8-Maximizer/
- **IITC Plugin**: Integrates with Ingress Intel Map to fetch portal and agent data automatically.

## Features

- Strategy generation based on agent roles, portal state, and VRBB use.
- Step-by-step simulation of portal evolution and deployment actions.
- Interactive UI to explore and compare strategy outcomes.
- Filtering by deployment quality, flip usage, and final portal alignment.
